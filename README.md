🚀 Task 3 Completed – Backend Integration & API Development
🔧 Android Internship @ ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.

In this phase of my internship, I explored the integration of backend services into an Android app using Retrofit and Jetpack Compose.

🔹 Implemented GET API calls using Retrofit 2
🔹 Parsed JSON data into Kotlin data classes
🔹 Used ViewModel + Kotlin Flow for state management
🔹 Displayed live data in a Jetpack Compose UI
🔹 Handled network permissions, API errors & clean architecture

💡 This task gave me real-world experience with API integration and laid the foundation for more complex features like authentication and data syncing.

Big thanks to @ApexPlanet for this opportunity 🙏
